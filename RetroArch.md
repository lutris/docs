## PlayStation Emulation

Libretro offers 3 different cores to emulate Playstation games.

* [PCSX Rearmed](https://docs.libretro.com/library/pcsx_rearmed/): This core offers basic emulation with no advanced features.  It can fallback to an emulated BIOS if none is found but it is still recommended to provide a BIOS for compatibility reasons.
* [Beetle PSX](https://docs.libretro.com/library/beetle_psx/): This core offers more precise emulation compared to PCSX but will require a valid BIOS file.
* [Beetle PSX HW](https://docs.libretro.com/library/beetle_psx_hw/): This is like the Beetle PSX core but with advanced rendering options. This core will give you the best visual results.

### Setting up BIOS files

Playstation BIOS files have to be placed in RetroArch's system directory (by default: `~/.config/retroarch/system`).
Make sure the files are correctly named and have the correct MD5 sum. The list below gives you the supported BIOS files and their checksums.
