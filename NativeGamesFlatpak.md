# Running Native Games Inside a Flatpak Environment

When attempting to run native Linux games through Flatpak, you may encounter issues where games do not launch properly due to library dependencies.

## Workaround

One effective workaround is to use a Flatpak terminal to launch the game. We recommend using [Konsole](https://flathub.org/apps/org.kde.konsole), as it offers a simple and straightforward solution.

### Steps to follow:

1. Install Konsole as a Flatpak application.

2. Add Konsole as a game in Lutris.

3. Go to the **Game Options** tab, and set `org.kde.konsole` in the **Application** field.

4. In the **Arguments** field, input `-e` followed by the path to the gameâ€™s launch script.

(If you want the konsole window to stay after you're done playing the game add the `--keep` arguement before `-e`)

   For example, the launch script in my case looks like this:

6. Click **Save**, and your game should now launch successfully.
