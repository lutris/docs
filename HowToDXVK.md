# What is DXVK?

[DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk) is a Vulkan-based compatibility layer for Direct3D 11. It allows running 3D applications on Linux using Wine.

For the current status of the project, please refer to the DXVK [wiki](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/wiki).

## Requirements:

- Wine >= 3.10
- [Wine dependencies](https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/WineDependencies.md) - Wine Staging is recommended
- [Vulkan capable GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan_(API)#Compatibility) - Note for Intel iGPU users: Only Skylake, Kaby Lake, and Coffee Lake offer full Vulkan support. Anything older is only partial. Although some games might work nothing is guaranteed.
- [Driver supported by DXVK.](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/wiki/Driver-support)
- [Vulkan loader, **both** 64-bit and 32-bit.](https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/InstallingDrivers.md)

## Installing Supported drivers:

To take advantage of DXVK and it's improved performance you ***must*** install a supported graphics driver and Vulkan dependencies.

**To learn how to do that, follow our guide here: _[Installing Drivers](https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/InstallingDrivers.md)_**
