## I want to remove dgVoodoo watermark

You can remove watermark by downloading dgvoodoo.conf for your version of dgvoodoo (lutris default should be 2.8.2) and setting `dgVoodooWatermark` to `false`.

**NOTE:** dgVoodoo is sensitive to config versions and refuses to load config if versions don't match!


## Configuration

Lutris dgVoodoo can be configured the same way as any other configuration by placing dgVoodoo.conf into the game folder.

**NOTE:** dgVoodoo is sensitive to config versions and refuses to load config if versions don't match!

### dgVoodoo.conf archive

You can download some of the dgvoodoo.conf files for specific versions from this repo as some of them are not (easily) optainable anymore.

**PS:** If you can't find your version try changing `Version` parameter in dgVoodoo.conf to your version of dgVoodoo. For example for version `2.8.2` you write `Version = 0x280` and for `2.83.3` you write `Version = 0x283`

- [Version 2.8.x](dgvoodoo-configs/280/dgVoodoo)
- [Version 2.79.x](dgvoodoo-configs/279/dgVoodoo)
